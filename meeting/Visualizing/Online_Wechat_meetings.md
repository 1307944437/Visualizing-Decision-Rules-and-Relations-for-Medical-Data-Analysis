## Before 20-3-2020
Continue to study Rawgraph, try to build JavaScript model, but because the mainland can not access some websites, the progress is slow.

## 1-4-2020
Demonstrated the test results of this period: users can simply drag and drop the level of Rawgraph online network diagram.
* Discussion:
The interaction required for the project is to drag and click directly within the chart, not to operate outside the chart.
* Challenges:
Find new tools to achieve interactivity.

## 11-4-2020
Demonstrate the results of testing new tools. I tried to use a JavaScript library called Echarts to achieve interactivity.
### Discussion:
This tool implements the required interactive function very well. It can drag and drop nodes to show or hide nodes according to the label.
### Challenges:
This beta version is currently only a static web page and cannot read external files as data. Next, I need to implement the file reading function.

## 20-4-2020
### Discussion:
The data file reading function is realized through the java program. Now I use java to generate html code and write the read csv file data to html. An html web page contains all the functions of interactive charts.
### Challenges:
Write a user interface to let users enter the address of the data file to make the project look more professional.

## 4-5-2020
### Discussion:
The user input interface is implemented. In order to prevent unknown errors, such as data problems in the machine learning group, some other work should be done to support my workload.
### Challenges:
Analyze the data before machine learning modeling and analysis, and display it as a chart.

## 8-5-2020
### Discussion:
The analysis of the input data cannot be adapted to all data sets, so we can only analyze what we are using.
### Challenges:
Analyze the data of a feature and make a graph to analyze the data distribution and prediction.

## 22-5-2020
### Discussion:
The content of the report.
